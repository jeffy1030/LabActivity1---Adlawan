        <h1>Dear God</h1>
        <h2>By: Avenged Sevenfold</h2>
        <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
        <img src="DearGodCover.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Avenged Sevenfold: Dear God">
    <p>
        <h3>Verse 1:</h1>
        A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
        <br>Miles away from those I love purpose undefined
        <br>While I recall all the words you spoke to me
        <br>Can't help but wish that I was there
        <br>And where I'd love to be, oh yeah
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chorus:</h1>
        Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
        <br>To hold her when I'm not around
        <br>When I'm much too far away
        <br>We all need that person who can be true to you
        <br>But I left her when I found her
        <br>And now I wish I'd stayed
        <br>'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
        <br>I'm missing you again oh no
        <br>Once again
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Verse 2:</h1>
        There's nothing here for me on this barren road
        <br>There's no one here while the city sleeps
        <br>And all the shops are closed
        <br>Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
        <br>Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chorus:</h1>
        Dear God the only thing I ask of you 
        <br>is to hold her when I'm not around
        <br>When I'm much too far away
        <br>We all need that person who can be true to you
        <br>I left her when I found her
        <br>And now I wish I'd stayed
        <br>'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
        <br>I'm missing you again oh no
        <br>
        Once again
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Bridge:</h1>
        Some search, never finding a way
        <br>Before long, they waste away
        <br>I found you, something told me to stay
        <br>I gave in, to selfish ways
        <br>And how I miss someone to hold
        <br>When hope begins to fade
        <br>A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
        <br>Miles away from those I love purpose undefined
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chorus:</h1>
        Dear God the only thing I ask of you 
        <br>is to hold her when I'm not around
        <br>When I'm much too far away
        <br>We all need the person who can be true to you
        <br>I left her when I found her
        <br>And now I wish I'd stayed
        <br>'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
        <br>I'm missing you again oh no
        <br>Once again 
        <br>
        <br>
